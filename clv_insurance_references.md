- **Date**: January 30, 2018
- **URL**: https://www.irisidentityprotection.com/blog/insurance-cost-customer-lifetime-value/
- **Summary**: This blog article explains the importance of customer lifetime value (CLV) for insurance companies and provides a practical formula for calculating it in the insurance industry: PVCLV = P – C – ABC (where P = Premiums paid, C = Cost of claims, and ABC = Cost of acquiring the customer). The article emphasizes that understanding CLV helps insurance companies align strategies with customer needs, focus resources appropriately, and increase customer retention. It notes that existing customers are 50% more likely to try new products and spend 31% more compared to new customers, making retention crucial for profitability.
